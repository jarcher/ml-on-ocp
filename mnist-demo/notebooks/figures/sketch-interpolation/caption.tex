Figure 1: Sketch of the algorithm for a single trace and $t_0$. To the left
is a trace from the CMP and to the right the corresponding trace from the NMO
corrected gather. The green square in the NMO is the amplitude  at $t_0$ that
we want to calculate. We apply the equation to find time $t$ in the CMP, then
interpolate the amplitude using the four samples around $t$ (orange
rectangles). This amplitude is then copied over to the NMO.
